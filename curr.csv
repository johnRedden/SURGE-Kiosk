1,3D Optical Reflections - Darwyn,Darwyn Ward,Dr. Lawrence Owens,"Optics, the study of the behavior of electromagnetic radiation, primarily light, is a subject of physics with many applications. Generally, physics approaches problems involving reflections  the bending of light waves due to contact with a reflecting surface  from a two-dimensional perspective using geometry. However, reflection is a phenomenon that exists in three-dimensional space, thus relations should be established that can help solve reflection problems in three dimensions.",mock2.jpg,mock1.jpg,3-D Optical Reflectiosn- Darwyn Ward.jpg
2,3D Optical Reflections - Jose,Jose Guerrero,Dr. Larry Owens,"This research project is based on an observation. Thus the physical application of this project came before the mathematics. The observation was that when a block of wood is sawed, if an edge of the block when looked at through the reflective side of the saw appears to continue without distortion through the plane of the saw, then the edge of the block and the plane of the saw are orthogonal.",white_T.jpg,SamJack.jpg,3-D Optical Revolution - Jose Barajas Guerro.jpg
3,How Diabetes Can Be Diagnosed Using A1C Testing,"Amy Quach, Grace Park",Nina Cano,"Diabetes, the fifth leading cause of death in developed countries, affects more than 9.4% of the American population due to its ability to damage most of the body's essential organs, leading to an increased risk in strokes, heart diseases, and peripheral vascular diseases.",mock2.jpg,mock1.jpg,A1C SURGE Presentation.jpg
4,The Science Behind Diagnosing Rheumatic Disease,Alec Cano,Nina Cano,"Identification of the antinuclear antibody (ANA) pattern is crucial in diagnosing systemic rheumatic diseases such as Lupus, Sjogren's Syndrome, and Sclerodrema.

21,Microbial communities in the root stocks and leaves of Cabernet Sauvignon,"Andres Martinez Perez, Julie Pedraza, Mala To, Justin King, Christopher M. Wallis",,"Ancient plants did not have the proper root systems for extraction of nutrients from the ground. More than 80% of higher plant species form a symbiotic relationship with arbuscular mycorrhizae, which are found in most ecosystems. The soil microbiota are responsible for many ecosystem functions such as plant growth regulation, nutrient cycling, & carbon sequestration.",mock2.jpg,mock1.jpg,USDA ARS Plant Pathology Internship-Andres Perez.jpg
22,Arduino-Controlled Gripper,"Graham Frazier, Kyle Sweeney, and Gerald Jumper",Dr. Larry Owens,"The study which inspired this project focused on the creation of a manually controlled grasping hand, to be used in laparoscopic surgery. The main purpose is to gently grasp tender objects like a pancreas. The fingers were created using a Shape Deposition Manufacturing (SDM) process, allowing for the imbedding of parts through milling and filling processes. The fingers could detect pressure on the tips through feedback given by tactile sensors. This feedback was used to alert the operator of the grasper when too much pressure is applied by the fingers, which could cause potential damage. We took this research and improved upon the hand to make it more durable and self-operated.",mock2.jpg,mock1.jpg,Soft Robotics Poster-Sweeney and Frasier.jpg
